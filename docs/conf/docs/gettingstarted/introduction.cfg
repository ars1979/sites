						WebYAML includes libraies of Elements, Processors and Templates for making webpages, user interfaces, and APIs.  WebYAML is Twitter Bootstrap ready, and includes many prebuilt elements, such as, headers, panels, tables, form fields and buttons.  Designers can easily add more elements without having to write any Python code.

						WebYAML also includes processors for basic functions, such as: connecting to data stores, handling data, business logic, sending emails, and saving files. Devlopers can create dynamic elements to add more functinality by extending the Element and Processor classes in Python.

						<strong>Note:</strong> WebYAML makes heavy use of YAML syntax.  As a result, most of the examples found in this documentation use YAML syntax.  YAML is designed to be human readable, and is similar to other serialized data such as JSON and Python data objects.  If you are not familiar with YAML, there are plenty of good references available.
